SYLLABUS 
CLASS TITLE: Real Estate Finance II 
SEMESTER YEAR: Fall 2024 
COURSE NUMBER: PLANA4312
I. COURSE DESCRIPTION 
Taught in conjunction with Underwriting Intensive, Real Estate Finance II will build upon the major topics from Real Estate Finance I and take a deeper dive into the mechanics of real estate debt and equity.
This core course will piece together micro-level components of finance through weekly homework. These assignments build on students’ technical skills week after week until the subject matter becomes clear, ultimately giving students a head start on the core material taught in the following semester.
Students will also gain exposure to a number of different mortgage products, equity structures and industry vernacular, as well as the major loan conditions and features that are utilized across all types of capital providers in various markets. In doing so, students will understand why real estate finance is such a large part of their education at Columbia and a crucial component of the commercial real estate industry.
II. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSIGNMENTS 
Students are expected to attend every class and complete and submit each homework assignment (if due) prior to the start of class. Each assignment will build on the previous assignment and will ultimately prepare students for their exams. All students are expected to complete their work individually.
Students are encouraged to bring questions to class so the course can focus on the areas students got stuck or needed clarification. Since homework is reviewed in detail, students are expected to heavily participate.
Office hours are always open. Please do not hesitate to come by, especially if you are struggling with the homework or concepts in class.
